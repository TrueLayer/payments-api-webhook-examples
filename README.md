# Payments API Webhook Examples

This repository contains code samples for verifying webhook signatures that originate from the TrueLayer Payments API.

[Payments API v1](https://docs.truelayer.com/#payments-api-v1) and [Payments API v2](https://docs.truelayer.com/#payments-api-v2) use different signing methods; the relevant code samples for each can be found in the v1 and v2 folders, respectively.

Each code sample contains a README.md file with specific instructions on running that sample.
